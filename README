This repository refers to the code described in the book Writing Netfilter Modules
by Jan Engelhardt and Nicolas Bouliane.
It also refers to corrections made to the book.

* IMPORTANT
* The corrections to the book are not finished.
* 
* Sounds obvious, but don't forget to load the ip_tables module before loading
* the xt_ipaddr module.
*
* Copy the shared library (libxt_ipaddr.so) into the iptables shared libraries 
* directory. 
* e.g.
* 	cp libxt_ipaddr.so /var/lib/iptables/
*
* You can test it with:
* 	iptables -m -ipaddr -h
* 	iptables -A INPUT -m ipaddr --ipsrc 127.0.0.1;
* You can then ping yourself and verify that it works checking the kernel messages
* (eg using dmesg).
